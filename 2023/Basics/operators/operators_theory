Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values) and then return a result.

--> Arithmetic operator
--> Relational operators or comparison operator
--> Assignment operators
--> Logical operators
--> Membership operators
--> Identity operators
--> Bitwise operators

Arithmetic operator:
    There are seven arithmetic operators we can use to perform different mathematical operations, such as:
        + (Addition)
        - (Subtraction)
        * (Multiplication)
        / (Division)
        // Floor division)
        ℅ (Modulus)
        ** (Exponentiation)

Addition operator +:

    --> It adds two or more operands and gives their sum as a result

            x = 10
            y = 40
            print(x + y)
            # Output 50

Subtraction - :

    --> Use to subtracts the second value from the first value and gives the difference between them.

            x = 10
            y = 40
            print(y - x)
            # Output 30

Multiplication * :

     --> it is used to multiplies two or more values and gives their product as a result.

            x = 2
            y = 4
            z = 5
            print(x * y)
            # Output 8 (2*4)
            print(x * y * z)
            # Outputx- 40 (2*4*5)

Division / :

    --> Divide the left operand (dividend) by the right one (divisor) and provide the result (quotient ) in a float value.

            x = 2
            y = 4
            z = 8
            print(y / x)
            # Output 2.0
            print(z / y / x)
            # Output 1.0
            # print(z / 0)  # error

Floor division // :

    --> It is used to divide one value by a second value and gives a quotient as a round figure value to the next smallest whole value.
    
            x = 2
            y = 4
            z = 2.2

            # floor division to get result as integer
            print(y // x)
            # Output 2

            # normal division
            print(y / z)  # 1.81

            # floor division.
            # Result as float because one argument is float
            print(y // z)  # 1.0

Modulus ℅ :

    --> Modulus operator divides one value by a second and gives the remainder as a result.

            x = 15
            y = 4

            print(x % y)
            # Output 3

Exponent ** :

    --> use it as a shortcut to calculate the exponential value.

        num = 2
        # 2*2
        print(num ** 2)
        # Output 4

        # 2*2*2
        print(num ** 3)
        # Output 8


Relational operators or comparision:

    --> It performs a comparison between two values.
    --> It returns a boolean  True or False depending upon the result of the comparison.

            > (Greater than)
            < (Less than)
            == (Equal to)
            != (Not equal to)
            >= (Greater than or equal to)
            <= (Less than or equal to)

>   It returns True if the left operand is greater than the right

        x = 10
        y = 5
        z = 2

        # > Greater than
        print(x > y)  # True
        print(x > y > z)  # True



<   It returns True if the left operand is less than the right


       print(y < x)  # True


==  It returns True if both operands are equal

        # Equal to
        print(x == y)  # False
        print(x == 10)  # True


!=  It returns True if both operands are equal

        # != Not Equal to
        print(x != y)  # True
        print(10 != x)  # False


>=  It returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right

        # >= Greater than equal to
        print(x >= y)  # True
        print(10 >= x)  # True


<=  It returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right


        # <= Less than equal to
        print(x <= y)  # False
        print(10 <= x)  # True

Assignment operators:

Assignment operators are used to assigning value to the variable.

    = (Assign)
    += (Add and assign)
    -= (Subtract and assign)
    *= (Multiply and assign)
    /= (Divide and assign)
    %= (Modulus and assign)
    **= (Exponentiation and assign)
    //= (Floor-divide and assign)

Logical operators :

Python has three logical operators.
All logical operator returns a boolean value True or False depending on the condition in which it is used.


and (Logical and): 	The logical and operator returns True if both expressions are True. Otherwise, it will return. False.


or (Logical or) : True if either of the operands is True

not (Logical not) : True if the operand is False
