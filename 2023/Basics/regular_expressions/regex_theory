--> in python re is an inbuilt package

--> To run any program using the regular expressions we need to import RE

--> regular expressions mainly having the four functions

    --> findall()
    --> search()
    --> split()
    --> sub()

--> In python we are having the MetaCharcters,SpecialSequences and sets

--> Meta Characters:

    --> []      --> A Set of Characters
    --> \       --> Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters)
    --> .       --> It will fill the remaing data

    --> +       --> one or more occurences
    --> ?       --> Zero or one ocuurence

    --> [a-n]       --> It will return the lower case letters are presented in between a-n
    --> [^abd]      --> It will return any charecter except a,b,d are presented
    --> [0,2,4]     --> It will return a match any particular digit is presented from the given pattern
    --> [0-9]       --> Returns a match for any digit ill get from 0-9
