--> A constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class.

--> The constructor is executed automatically at the time of object creation.

--> The primary use of a constructor is to declare and initialize data member/ instance variables of a class

--> The constructor contains a collection of statements (i.e., instructions) that executes at the time of object creation to initialize the attributes of an object.

--> if we execute result = main() python get to know result is the object and main is the class method and calls the constructor at the time of result creation

--> using the __init__ method we can implement constructor to initialize the object.

--> using the __init__() method we can implement constructor to initialize the object.

--> def keyword is used to define a function

--> __init__() method is called as soon as an object of class is instantiated.

--> by default self is the parameter to the constructor

--> Self binds the instance to the __init__() method. Itâ€™s usually named self to follow the naming convention.

--> in the __init__ method arguments are optional

--> we can define the constructor with the number of arguments

--> for every object the constructor will be called once

--> if we call the object for 5 times means the object will be called 4 times

--> in python we are having three types of constructors

    --> default constructor
    --> parameterized constructor      --> def __init__(self,name,age,kiran)
    --> non-parameterized constructor  --> def __init__()

default constructor:

    --> It is an empty constructor without a body.
    --> If forget to implement any constructor in your class or forget to declare it, the Python inserts a default constructor into your code on your behalf.
    --> The default constructor is not present in the source py file
    --> It is inserted into the code during compilation

non_parameterized constructor:

--> A constructor without any arguments is called a non-parameterized constructor.
--> This type of constructor is used to initialize each object with default values.
--> non-parameterized constructor dont accept the arguments during the object creation.
--> It initializes the same set of values


parameterized constructor:

--> A constructor with defined parameters or arguments is called a parameterized constructor.
--> We can pass different values to each object at the time of creation using a parameterized constructor.
--> The first parameter to constructor is self that is a reference to the being constructed.
--> The remaining arguments are need to be enter by the user.
--> A parameterized constructor have any number of arguments


constructor with default values:

--> Python allows to define a constructor with default values at the time of constructor creation


Self Keyword in python:

--> self is the first parameter in python.
